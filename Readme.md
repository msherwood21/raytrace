Raytrace Rust
=============

## What Is This?
The results of me going through [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
Instead of coding it in C++, I'm doing it in Rust to teach myself the language. This has already been
done elsewhere (look [here](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/wiki/Implementations-in-Other-Languages])),
but I will not be looking at that source until I've tried my hand here.

## Can I Use It?
Check the [License](License.md) file for usage details

## Can I Add To It?
Just fork it and go on your merry way. Once I'm done learning I will not be touching the repository again.

## Versions
- Rust toolchain: 1.45.1
- Ray Tracing In One Weekend: v3.2.0
